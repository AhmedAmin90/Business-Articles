#  BUSINESS ARTICLES !
 
> In this project, I created a web application using Ruby on Rails for writing business articles dividing into four categories (Enterprenurship, Marketing, Economy and Technology).
# In this application:
- You can create a new user.
- Users can create and vote articles and edit and delete only their articles.
- The header and footer are fixed for all pages.
- The home page contains two sections, the main section which has the article with large number of votes:

and the second one four boxes each box represent one category and contain the details of most recent article in this category.

<img src="./imgs/homepage-2.png">

- The category archive page contain all articles cards under this category, and this card contains:
1. Title
2. Author name
3. 150 letters from the article.
4. Vote button.
5. Votes counter.
6. Feature image of this article.
